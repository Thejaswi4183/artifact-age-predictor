# 🏛️ Ancient Artifact Age Predictor

A full-stack web app that predicts the age of ancient artifacts (like coins, sculptures, inscriptions) using a trained ML model. The app features GitHub/email-based login via Supabase, FastAPI backend for inference, and a parchment-inspired aesthetic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🖥️ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

⚙️ Backend Setup (FastAPI)
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Make sure your main.py exposes a POST /predict route that accepts images and returns age.

---

🔐 Supabase Configuration

Create a Supabase project

Enable GitHub and Email auth

Add redirect URL: http://localhost:3000/upload

Create users and artifacts tables to store metadata

---

🔮 Prediction API Format

Endpoint: POST /predict

Body: Form-data with image file

Response:
```bash
{
  "predicted_age": 1247.58
}

```

---

🧾 Logs

Logs are stored in the artifacts table

Includes: username, image_url, prediction, timestamp

---
🧠 Model Info

You can plug in any custom image-based artifact dating model (CNN, ResNet, etc.) inside the FastAPI backend. Ensure proper preprocessing and return the predicted value with 2 decimal precision.
